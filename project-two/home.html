      <p> The Shenandoah Valley, affectionately nicknamed “Big Valley,” is an Appalachian region that stretches across Virginia and West Virginia. It is home to the Blue Ridge Mountains, the Shenandoah River, and over 1,400 species of vascular plants (plants with roots, stems, and leaves). While all types of plants contribute to the delicate ecosystem of the Valley, nothing draws visitors quite like the wildflowers. Ranging in size, color, and shape, the 800+ species of wildflowers blanket the landscape in vibrant color from early spring to late fall. There are many recognizable species of wildflowers in the Valley, such as wild columbine, a vivid red buttercup that grows alongside Shenandoah National Park’s Skyline Drive, Queen Anne’s Lace, a delicate white bloom from the carrot family, and Philadelphia Fleabane, a pink aster that clusters on the sides of many trails. On this site, we’ll explore four of my personal favorite species: Virginia Spiderwort, Virginia Bluebells, Dame’s Rocket, and Pink Lady’s Slipper. </p>
