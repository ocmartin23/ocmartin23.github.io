          <p>Hey y'all! I'm Olivia Martin (or Liv, if you prefer), and my pronouns are she/they. I'm a class of '23 mathematics major at Goshen College, with a minor in graphic design and special interests in statistical analysis, data visualization, and education research and policy.</p></br>
          <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>The best day of my life was the day I saw a black bear in Shenandoah National Park. The greatest regret of my life is that I was driving and couldn't take a picture.</li>
            <li>I own a growing collection of crowns and tiaras, which I wear on special occasions and around the house for fun and emotional support.</li>
            <li>A few years ago I saw people online making earrings from worms on a string. I decided to try it out, but things got out of hand and now I'm the Worm Queen. I made crown jewels and a worm gown.</li>
            <li>I love the eldritch horror genre (think <em>Old Gods of Appalachia, The Magnus Archives,</em> and H.P. Lovecraft) but I can't stand horror movies and video games.</li>
            <li>My favorite musical artists are Hozier and Lord Huron. My favorite visual artists are Vincent Van Gogh, Ingo Swann, and Bianca Roman-Stumpff. </ul>
        </br>
        <h2>Testimonials</h2>
        <p>I asked some of my friends to describe me for this page. I thought they would give me a few words or some short phrases that I could use for fun facts, but instead they made me happy cry for sport.</p></br>
        <ul>
          <li>"Olivia is a dedicated worker and friend. She is friendly and always willing to help those around her. I cannot think of a better person to ask for help with a project." </br>—Aubri, Squishmallow master and gamer extraordinaire</li>
        <li>"If I had to boil all of Liv's wonderful personality into three words, I would choose outgoing, adventurous, and caring. She seems to know everything about everyone and isn't afraid of meeting new people. For Liv, adventure can be found wherever in life and she is always seeking out grand ways of making that happen. And lastly, she is caring. Liv remembers favorite foods and shows and takes the time to listen to people and help them with whatever they are struggling with." </br> —Marci, general of my armies and Queen Charlotte enthusiast</li>
