    <title> Olivia's Silly Test Site </title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1> There's a TITLE now! </h1>
    <p> Oh my GOD, there's TEXT! </p>

    <h2> A Less Prominent Header </h2>
    <p> Behold, Olivia Ann Martin, Content Creator. </p>

    <h2> Lists! </h2>
    <p> Oh lawd, we listin'! </p>

    <ul>
      <li> I typed some letters! </li>
      <li> And now you observe a bulleted list. </li>
      <li> Is this when I get the Sims trait Webmaster? </li>
      <li> Also, because I'll forget otherwise, note to self:
           use MDN when confused about HTML elements. </li>
    </ul>

    <p> Ok, so this is also a list, but ordered. </p>

    <ol>
      <li> This is the same as before, but with a different letter. </li>
      <li> Well, the letters for the list items are the same </li>
      <li> But there are numbers now! </li>
    </ol>

<h2> Inline Elements (Basically, Formatting) </h2>
<p> Now <em> this </em> is what I call style.
    Times New Roman 12 point font, but with <em> zest. </em> </p>
<p> And <strong> this </strong> is what I call bold.
    Because that's what it's called. </p>
<P> And <em> <strong> this </strong> </em> is what I call a little too much.
    Must we yell?

<h2> Empty Elements </h2>
<p> I have such a strong urge to brag about line breaks right now...
    <br/> I won't, but I really want to. </p>

    <hr/>

<p> I give up. Kwame Alexander said my line breaks were "near perfect."
    That's a real thing he said! </p>
